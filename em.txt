Dear Prof. Dr. Abedjan,

I have sent you an extended version of my proposal. The first two pages are the same as the old version, I think they explain the goal, problem and solution. There are two new pages added which contain my thoughts sketch of the following work.

It's the mass production season of Samsung, so I'm sorry I haven't found enough time to put my thoughts into practice. Some details still need to be further discussed. I'll try my best to improve this. Please share your opinions with me. Thank you very much!

Sincerely,
Chen Binger
